# 🥭 Mango - AI Ad Creative Platform

Mango is a professional-grade AI application designed to generate high-converting Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok ad creatives. Unlike generic image generators, Mango uses a sophisticated **Multi-Agent System** that mimics a real-world creative agency workflow: Strategy → Art Direction → Production → Copywriting.

Built with **React 19**, **Tailwind CSS**, and powered by **Google's Gemini 3 Pro** models.
